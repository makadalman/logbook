# Skydiving Adventures (for now, just for me)

I like to jump out of planes with my friends, sometimes, just a few friends, sometimes a _lot_ of friends.
Keeping track of statistics is kinda fun.
* distance fallen
* total freefall time
* formation sizes
* number of jumps
  * by location
  * by team
  * by month
  * by year
  * by aircraft
* gear
  * containers
  * canopies
  * line sets

Data visualization has always made me weirdly happy. And in the meantime, I'm learning how to utilize MUI with React, on top of a Supabase database.
More ideas for graphs and charts to come, along with a training tool (the daily dive) that I have been working on in a separate project.
